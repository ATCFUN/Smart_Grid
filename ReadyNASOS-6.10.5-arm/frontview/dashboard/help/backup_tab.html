            <p class="p">Your ReadyNAS system can manage backup and recovery for many devices on your network.
                  For example, you can back up data that is stored on your ReadyNAS storage system
                  to secondary devices, such as a USB drive. You can also use your ReadyNAS storage
                  system to store backed-up data from other devices, like your laptop.</p>

            <p class="p" id="concept_backup_and_recovery__p_d1e23"> If your data is important enough to store, it is important enough to
                  back up. Data can be lost due to a number of events, including natural disaster
                  (for example, fire or flood), theft, improper data deletion, and hard drive
                  failure. If you regularly back up your data, you can recover your data if any of
                  these situations occur.</p>

            <p class="p" id="concept_backup_and_recovery__p_d1e28"> Businesses sometimes use backup data to comply with data retention
                  regulations and to archive information before making major changes to their IT
                  environments, such as batch updates to databases. At home and in business
                  settings, back up important data that might be lost due to a natural disaster or
                  the loss of a device that stores data.</p>

ReadyNAS OS provides both file backups, just called backups, and snapshot backups,     called ReadyDR backups. Both operate similarly and both provide copies of your data, but because     of the underlying differences, depending on what you are backing up and why, one might be better     than the other for your specific case.</li>

</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a href="backup_panel_readydr.html">Backup Snapshots With ReadyDR</a><br/>
ReadyDR is an alternative way to back up data on your ReadyNAS     system.     A ReadyNAS backup makes a copy of files, but a ReadyDR backup makes a copy of the snapshots on a     share or LUN.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a href="backup_tab_6.html">Back Up a Camera or Other Media Device</a><br/>
Many cameras and other media devices support the Media Transfer Protocol (MTP) and the     Picture Transfer Protocol (PTP). You can configure your ReadyNAS to backup such devices when you     connect them to the ReadyNAS.</li>
<li class="link olchildlink"><a href="backup_wnd_edit_tm.html">Back Up Using Time Machine</a><br/>
You can use Mac OS X Time Machine and your ReadyNAS storage system to back up and     retrieve data for your Mac computer. This combines the ease of a native Mac backup with the     space and reliability of your ReadyNAS.</li>
