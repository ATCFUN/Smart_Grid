  <h1 class="title topictitle1">What Is Disk Spin-Down</h1>

  
  
  
   <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">Disk spin-down reduces the rotation speed of your ReadyNAS disks. When the disks are
    spun down, power consumption is reduced, the disks are quieter, and disk life is extended.
    However, the disks must spin back up before the ReadyNAS can read or write data to them. This
    can cause an apparent slow down in disk performance and, depending on the application, can cause
    time-outs.</p>

      <p class="p">You can control whether spin-down is used, how long a period of inactivity is needed before
      disk spin-down, and if used, what days and times it is enabled. If you use spin-down and also
      use applications that automatically read or write to the disks, either disable spin-down when
      the applications start writing to the disks, or verify that the disks spin back up fast enough
      not to cause a time out. It can take up to 10 seconds for disks to spin up. In some file
      server applications, a 10-second delay might be acceptable. For databases, virtualization, and
      many applications, the delay might cause the application or host operating system to time out
      and return an error.</p>

      <div class="p">The energy saved depends on model, but a common figure is that a drive uses 5.3W during
      read/write operations, 3.4W while idle, and only 0.4W while in standby or sleep
        mode.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> Hourly snapshots are not taken for spun-down disks, but daily snapshots are
        taken.</div>
