  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Backup Snapshots With ReadyDR</h1>

  
  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">ReadyDR is an alternative way to back up data on your ReadyNAS
    system.
    A ReadyNAS backup makes a copy of files, but a ReadyDR backup makes a copy of the snapshots on a
    share or LUN.</p>

      <p class="p">Because a ReadyDR backup consists of snapshots, you can retrieve not just the most recent
      version of a file, but the same previous versions that you could access on the ReadyNAS
      itself.</p>

      <p class="p">However, because the ReadyDR backup is share to ReadyDR share or LUN to ReadyDR share, both
      the source and destination must be on a ReadyNAS
      system,
      and if the source and destination are on different ReadyNAS
      systems,
      the communication method is specific to ReadyDR.
      </p>

      <p class="p">The ReadyNAS
      system
      on which you create the ReadyDR job manages the communication for the job. This requires
      that the
      other ReadyNAS system
      validate the
      connection to the
      first
      system.
      If you log in to the second system from the first system when you create the ReadyDR job,
      ReadyDR exchanges the first system's private key automatically. If you cannot log in,
      you
      must copy the public key from the first
      system
      and install it on the second
      system
      before creating the ReadyDR job. For information about transferring the key, see <a class="xref" href="backup_panel_readydr_1.html" title="ReadyDR jobs are managed by the system on which the job was created. When a ReadyDR job is created, and when the systems exchange ReadyDR data, the second system validates the connection to the first system using the first system's private key. If you log in to the second system from the first system over HTTPS when you create the job, the key is automatically exchanged. If you cannot log in, you must download and exchange the public key for the managing device so that the other device can validate the connection.">Load System Access Key Before Using ReadyDR</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">A complete share or LUN including snapshots can be large, so the initial data transfer could
      take a substantial amount of time. To shorten this initial transfer period, you can seed the
      job with a complete copy of the share or LUN by exporting it to removable media and then
      importing it onto the destination ReadyNAS. For more information about seeding a ReadyDR job,
      see <a class="xref" href="backup_panel_readydr_2.html" title="When a ReadyDR job first runs, all of the data on the share or LUN must be transferred to the destination. For large shares or LUNs, transfering this much data over the network can take a long time. You can eliminate this large initial network transfer by seeding the job by transferring the data using removable media.">Seed a ReadyDR Job</a>.</p>

      <p class="p">You can create, configure, and delete ReadyDR backup and recovery jobs. You can also manually
      start jobs and clear the job log.</p>
