   <div class="body conbody" id="conbody_d1e764"><p class="shortdesc">A ReadyDR backup job backs up the snapshots on a share or LUN. The destination must be
        a ReadyDR share, which is created when you create the job.</p>

      <p class="p">Before you create a ReadyDR job between a local and remote system, you must download the
            public key for the system on which you are creating the job, and import that key to the
            other device. If you log in to the other system over HTTPS from the system creating the
            job, the systems exchange the key for you, otherwise you must manually exchange the keys
            before you create the job. For information about exchanging the key, see <a class="xref" href="backup_panel_readydr_1.html" title="ReadyDR jobs are managed by the system on which the job was created. When a ReadyDR job is created, and when the systems exchange ReadyDR data, the second system validates the connection to the first system using the first system's private key. If you log in to the second system from the first system over HTTPS when you create the job, the key is automatically exchanged. If you cannot log in, you must download and exchange the public key for the managing device so that the other device can validate the connection.">Load System Access Key Before Using ReadyDR</a>.</p>

        <div class="p">The initial data transfer in a ReadyDR job transfers all of the data in the share or LUN.
            If this transfer occurs over a network, it might take a long time if the network is
            slow. During job creation you can create a seed archive file, copy it to removable
            media, and import it to the destination, and avoid the initial network transfer. For
            information about seeding, see <a class="xref" href="backup_panel_readydr_2.html" title="When a ReadyDR job first runs, all of the data on the share or LUN must be transferred to the destination. For large shares or LUNs, transfering this much data over the network can take a long time. You can eliminate this large initial network transfer by seeding the job by transferring the data using removable media.">Seed a ReadyDR Job</a>.<div class="note note"><span class="notetitle">Note:</span> 
                A destination LUN is always a thin LUN, even if the source LUN is a thick LUN. For
                information about thick and thin LUNs, see <a class="xref" href="iscsi_tab_2.html">Thin and Thick Provisioning</a>.</div>
