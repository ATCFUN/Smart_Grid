  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Configure Static Routes</h1>

  

  <div class="body taskbody"><p class="shortdesc">You can add and remove static routes. Static routes are not frequently used with
    ReadyNAS, but a few situations call for them. For example, if no automatically routed path to a
    device exists that the ReadyNAS must access, you can define a static path to it.</p>

      <div class="section prereq p">Before configuring a static route, you must configure the ReadyNAS adapter, its Ethernet
      address, and subnet mask. <p class="p">To configure a static route, there must be a gateway between the
        network the ReadyNAS is on, and the network with the destination address. There is an
        address for the gateway on the network the ReadyNAS is on, and there is an address for the
        gateway on the network the destination address is on. Before configuring the static route,
        determine the gateway address on the network the ReadyNAS is on. You must also know the
        target IP address and the subnet mask for the target's network.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="section context">As a sample configuration, your ReadyNAS uses separate network connections to connect
      to the Internet and to a private network, and the default gateway is configured to connect to
      the Internet. The ReadyNAS can connect to anything on the private network and on the Internet,
      but if another private network is connected to the private network, the ReadyNAS cannot
      automatically find devices on the second private network. For example, one network interface
      on the ReadyNAS might use the address 10.1.0.1 to connect to a private network with addresses
      in the range 10.1.xxx.xxx. The 10.1 network connects to a private network with a server with
      the address 192.168.1.0 and with subnet mask 255.255.255.0. No automatic route exists from the
      ReadyNAS to the server, but you can specify a static route. For this example, the address
      10.1.0.2 is the address of the gateway between the two private networks.</div>
