  <h1 class="title topictitle1">Backups Compared to ReadyDR Backups</h1>

  

  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">ReadyNAS OS provides both file backups, just called backups, and snapshot backups,
    called ReadyDR backups. Both operate similarly and both provide copies of your data, but because
    of the underlying differences, depending on what you are backing up and why, one might be better
    than the other for your specific case.</p>

      <p class="p">A file backup is a copy of the file that exists at the time of the back up. The backup
      contains no history of the file. (Although you can maintain file history by maintaining older
      backups.) A ReadyDR backup consists of all of the snapshots on a share or LUN. You have the
      same snapshot history in the ReadyDR backup as you do in the original. You can retrieve
      previous versions of a file in the same way you can retrieve previous versions through the
      original snapshots.</p>
