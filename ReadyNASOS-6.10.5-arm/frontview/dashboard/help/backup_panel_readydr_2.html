  <div class="body conbody"><p class="shortdesc">When a ReadyDR job first runs, all of the data on the share or LUN must be transferred
    to the destination. For large shares or LUNs, transfering this much data over the network can
    take a long time. You can eliminate this large initial network transfer by seeding the job by
    transferring the data using removable media.</p>

      <p class="p"> If you seed a ReadyDR job, it must be seeded before the job runs the first time. When you
      create the job, you can select the <span class="ph uicontrol">Export seed for this job</span> checkbox to
      stop the job before it runs. You can then create the seed archive. After importing the seed
      archive on the destination device, you restart the job. </p>

      <p class="p">You create a seed by exporting the share or LUN after you create the job. For more
      information about creating a seed file, see <a class="xref" href="backup_panel_readydr_4.html" title="You can manually start a job, view the job history, export a seed file, delete the job, enable a stopped job, and change the job settings.">Monitor and Change ReadyDR Jobs</a>.</p>
