   <div class="body conbody" id="conbody_d1e92">
      <p class="p" id="concept_d1e92__p_d1e99"> Users are the people to whom you grant access to your storage system. If your
   company uses Windows Active Directory, you can use that to manage ReadyNAS users. Otherwise, when
   you want to allow someone to access your ReadyNAS system, you create a user account for that
   person. The ReadyNAS storage system administrator sets up user accounts and decides which folders
   and LUNs each user is permitted to access. </p>

      <p class="p" id="concept_d1e92__p_d1e104"> If your ReadyNAS storage system is used at home, you might create a user account
   for each member of the family, but allow only the parents to access financial data stored on your
   system. You might decide that all user accounts can access photos and music stored on the system.
   You can set the appropriate permissions for each user.</p>

      <p class="p" id="concept_d1e92__p_d1e109"> The ReadyNAS system administrator can set up groups to make it easier to manage
   large numbers of users. For example, if your ReadyNAS storage system is being used in a business,
   you might decide that every employee requires a user account. However, you might decide that only
   users in the accounting department can access information in the accounting shared folder, but
   that all users can access data stored in the company benefits shared folder. You can create a
   group for each department and place all users in the appropriate group or groups.</p>

      <div class="p">The ReadyNAS system administrator account allows special priviledges. The ReadyNAS system
   administrator can grant most, but not all, of these special priviledges to any user by assigning
   that user to the user group admin. Examples of these special priviledges available to secondary
   admin accounts include access to all Home Folders, and full access to control of networking
   protocols. Secondary admin accounts cannot do the following:<ul class="ul" id="concept_d1e92__ul_u11_scs_t1b">
            <li class="li">Disable themselves</li>

            <li class="li">Perform password recovery</li>

            <li class="li">Perform password reset</li>

         </ul>
